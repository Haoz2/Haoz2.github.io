### About Me
      
I am a Master degree candidate in Civil Engineering under supervision of Professor Wang-xinzhi. I am affliated with <a href="http://www.sklgme.org/">State Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.whrsm.ac.cn/">Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics</a> at <a href="http://www.cas.ac.cn/">CAS</a> . I got my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.hfut.edu.cn/">Hefei University of Technology</a>. You can reach me through my email address haozeal at gmail dot com.


### Research

In the broadest sense, I do research regarding how to bridge soil mechanics, geology and continuum mechanics together. I have a particular interest in studying mechanical properties of calcareous sand where structural characteristics of coral reefs is involved, and their applications in Sedimentary evolution.
