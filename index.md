### Research

<p style="text-align:justify">
In the broadest sense, I do research regarding how to bridge soil mechanics, geology and continuum mechanics together. I have a particular interest in studying mechanical properties of calcareous sand where structural characteristics of coral reefs is involved, and their applications in Sedimentary evolution.
