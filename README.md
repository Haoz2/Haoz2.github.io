### About Me

I am a Master degree candidate in Civil Engineering under supervision of Professor Wang-xinzhi. I am affliated with [State Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering](http://www.sklgme.org/) and [Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanicsat](http://www.whrsm.ac.cn/) at [CAS](http://www.cas.ac.cn/). I got my bachelor's degree from [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/). You can reach me through my email address haozeal at gmail dot com.

### Research

In the broadest sense, I do research regarding how to bridge soil mechanics ,  geology and continuum mechanics together. I have a particular interest in studying mechanical properties of calcareous sand where structural characteristics of coral reefs is involved, and their applications in Sedimentary evolution.
